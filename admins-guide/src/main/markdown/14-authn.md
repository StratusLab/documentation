## Authentication Methods

As mentioned in the previous chapter, the CIMI server also handles all
of the authentication for the cloud.  The server supports either
password or certificate credentials and the use of internal or
external databases.

The various supported combinations are:

  * User entries in Couchbase with password credentials,
  * User entries in Couchbase with certificate credentials,
  * User entries in LDAP with password credentials,
  * User entries in LDAP with certificate credentials (soon), and 
  * VOMS proxy authentication.

This chapter explainsthe configuration necessary to enable or disable
these authentication mechanisms.
