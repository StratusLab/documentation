System administrators wanting to install a StratusLab cloud on their

## Typographic Conventions

This guide uses several typographic conventions to improve the
readability.

---------  ---------------------------------------
links      [some link](http://example.org/)
filenames  `$HOME/.stratuslab/stratuslab-user.cfg`
commands   `stratus-run-instance`
options    `--version`
---------  ---------------------------------------

Table: Typographic Conventions

Extended examples of commands and their outputs are displayed in the
monospace Courier font.  Within these sections, command lines are
prefixed with a '$ ' prompt.  Lines without this prompt are output
from the previous command.  For example, 

    $ stratus-run-instance -q BN1EEkPiBx87_uLj2-sdybSI-Xb
    5507, 134.158.75.75

the `stratus-run-instance` is the command line which returns the
virtual machine identifier and IP address.
