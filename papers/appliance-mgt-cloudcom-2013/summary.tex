\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

The StratusLab Marketplace has been operated in a federated cloud
environment for more than two years.  Over that time, it has evolved,
taking into account operational and user concerns.  A roadmap has been
defined to make the service even more reliable and functional.  With
its platform agnostic design, we look forward to interfacing the
service with another IaaS cloud distribution.
