Cloud infrastructures provide compelling features for scientific and
engineering applications.  Federated clouds additionally promise
geographic service redundancy and access to more resources.  Effective
use of federated clouds requires the creation of portable appliances
and consistent appliance management techniques.  The StratusLab
Marketplace, a platform-agnostic appliance registry, facilitate
appliance management in a federated environment.  This paper describes
the Marketplace design goals, implementation, and security concerns.
It also covers the planned improvements based on our experience of
running this service in production for more than two years.
