StratusLab provides a complete, open-source solution for deploying an
``Infrastructure as a Service'' (IaaS) cloud infrastructure.  Use of
IaaS clouds requires the preparation of virtual machine images (or
appliances)--a tedious and error-prone process that represents a
significant hurdle for users.  The Marketplace helps overcome this
hurdle by facilitating the sharing of appliances.  It serves as a
registry for shared appliances for the StratusLab distribution and
could be easily adapted to any IaaS cloud implementation.  Through its
use of crytographically-signed image metadata, the Marketplace
promotes trust between the appliance creators, users, and cloud
administrators.  This paper discusses in detail the Marketplace design
goals, implementation, security concerns, and experiences from running
the service in several production settings.
