To effectively use federated cloud infrastructures, users must be able
to create identical computational environments on all of the clouds in
the federation.  Although creating separate appliances for each cloud
solves this problem, this solution is neither scalable nor reliable.
A better solution allows users to create a single appliance and to use
it transparently on all of the federated clouds.  The StratusLab
Marketplace, a registry of available appliances, facilitates such a
solution.  This paper describes in detail the Marketplace design
goals, implementation, and security concerns.  It also covers the
planned improvements based on our experience of running this service
in production for more than two years on a federated cloud
infrastructure.
