To effectively use federated cloud infrastructures, users must be able
to create identical computational environments on all of the clouds in
the federation.  Although creating separate appliances for each cloud
solves this problem; this solution is neither scalable nor reliable.
A better solution allows users to create a single appliance and to use
it transparently on all of the federated clouds.  The StratusLab
``Infrastructure as a Service'' cloud distribution provides the
necessary tools to achieve this.  At the center of this ecosystem is
the StratusLab Marketplace, an open registry of available appliances.
This paper describes in detail the Marketplace design goals,
implementation, and security concerns.  It also covers the planned
improvements based on our experience of running this service in
production for more than two years.
