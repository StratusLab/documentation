Cloud infrastructures provide compelling features for scientific and
engineering applications.  Federated clouds additionally promise
improved scalability via access to a larger pool of resources and
improved service availability through geographically distributed
redundant servers.  Effective use of federated clouds requires the
creation of portable appliances and consistent appliance management
techniques.  The StratusLab Marketplace, a platform-agnostic appliance
registry, facilitates appliance management in a federated environment.
This paper describes the Marketplace design goals, implementation, and
security concerns.  It also covers the planned improvements based on
our experience of running this service in production for more than two
years.
