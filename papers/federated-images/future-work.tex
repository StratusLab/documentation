\section{Future Work}

Description of the current issues and how the next implementation will
deal with them. 

Points for improvement:
\begin{itemize}
\item Difficult to determine the quality of listed images.  Croudsource
  this with something like DISCUS?
\item Single point of failure.  Need to allow for replication.  (Git as
  storage mechanism?)
\item Need for public/private instances (Git as management backend to
  merge different repositories?)
\item SPARQL queries are essentially unused by users (but used
  internally).  Remove to simplify code?
\item Need to have fixed URL for latest in a series of images.
\item Allow 'prettier' descriptions of the images in the Marketplace.
\end{itemize}
