\section{Integration with Cloud Implementations}
\label{sec:related-components}

{\em Describe what components are necessary to integrate the
  Marketplace with a IaaS cloud implementation. This should emphasize
  that it could be integrated into different cloud stacks.  This
  should be easy!}

To integrate the Marketplace with cloud deployments, three additional
components are necessary:

\paragraph{Resolver} This resolves a given URL into a set of metadata
  entries.  Currently only Marketplace metadata URLs are supported, so
  this is simply an HTTP GET on the URL and not a separate component.

\paragraph{Download} This is implemented in the
  \cmd{stratus-download-image} command.  It supports any transport
  supported natively by python.

\paragraph{Policy Engine} This is implemented in \cmd{stratus-policy-image}
  command.  It will validate the metadata entries against a site
  policy.  It currently implements signature validation, endorser
  white and black lists, and checksum blacklist.

All of these are used on the cloud side and are not visible to end
users.  Cloud administrators, however, may find them useful in certain
circumstances.
