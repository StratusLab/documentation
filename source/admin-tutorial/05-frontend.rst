Front End Installation
======================

Finalize Front End Installation
-------------------------------

Now that we have defined all of the configuration parameters, you can
now do the full Front End installation by issuing the following
command::

    $ stratus-install -vv

To get more details on what the command is (because of curiosity or
errors), use the option ``-v``, ``-vv``, or ``-vvv``.

If you run into errors, the ``stratus-install`` command can simply be
rerun after adjusting the configuration parameters.
