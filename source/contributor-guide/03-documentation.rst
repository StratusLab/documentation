Documentation
=============

Repository Documentation
------------------------

Each code repository must have a README (in markdown format). It must
contain the following:

-  A description describing the purpose of the code
-  A statement about the license
-  Any acknowledgements (e.g. for the European Commission)

It can also describe:

-  Manual installation instructions for the service
-  Firewall and port requirements
-  Dependencies

or any other relevant information.

Guides
------

The collaboration maintains three guides: one for users, one for
administrators, and one for contributors. These should be reviewed and
updated when significant changes are made to the code. These *must* be
reviewed before each release.
