StratusLab Documentation
========================

StratusLab is a complete cloud distribution that allows you to install
an "Infrastructure as a Service" cloud on your own hardware.  The
StratusLab distribution aims to be simple to use, simple to install,
and simple to maintain.

The documentation contains guides and tutorials for both users and
administrators.  If the guides don't answer your questions, contact
the developers through `GitHub <http://github.com/stratuslab>`__ or
our `support mailing list <mailto:support@stratuslab.eu>`__.
