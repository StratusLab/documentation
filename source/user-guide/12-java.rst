Java
====

Although Python is the primary programming language used by the
StratusLab client, a small portion uses Java--specifically the portions
related to the creation, validation, and signing of metadata for the
Marketplace.

For these features, an installation of a certified Java 1.7 or later
distribution is required.

Linux Operating Systems
-----------------------

Most Linux distributions contain an acceptable set of Java
packages--usually `OpenJDK <http://www.openjdk.org/>`__. These can be
installed with the distribution's standard package management tools.

Oracle's Java distributions can also be used. Instructions for obtaining
and installing these distributions are available from the `Java
website <http://java.com/>`__.

The Java compiler created from GNU (GJC) will **not** work. If this is
installed, either remove it from your system or ensure that it is not
the default version of Java on your system.

Mac OS X
--------

Oracle provides a distribution of Java for recent versions of Mac OS X.
You can download and install this version from the primary `Java
website <http://java.com/>`__.

Older versions of Mac OS X also incorporate their own version of java
that will work with the StratusLab client, although the more recent
Oracle releases are preferred.

Windows
-------

Download and install Java from the primary `Java
website <http://java.com>`__.
