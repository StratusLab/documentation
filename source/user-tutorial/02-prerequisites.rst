Prerequisites
=============

To follow this tutorial, you must have a machine running a recent
version of Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows and the ability to install and
configure software on that machine.

Linux and Mac OS X are fully supported and tested.  The core features
work also on Windows, although there are a few commands that do not.
Those commands that do not work on Windows are pointed out in the
documentation.

To take advantage of all of the StratusLab features, you must have the
following software installed and configured:

-  Python 2 (2.6+)
-  ``pip``, the python package installer
-  Java 1.6+ (any certified distribution)
-  SSH client (with an SSH keypair)
-  Recent web browser

You may optionally install the python ``virtualenv`` to isolate the
StratusLab python environment from others.  All of the supported
platforms have widely available versions of these software packages
available.

.. note::

   The commands that require the Java Virtual Machine will not be used
   in this tutorial, so you do not need to install Java for this
   tutorial.
