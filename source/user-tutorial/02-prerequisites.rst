Prerequisites
=============

To follow this tutorial, you must have a machine running a recent
version of Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows.  Linux and Mac OS X are fully
supported and tested.  A few commands do not work on Windows; these
are pointed out in the tutorial.

Your machine must have the following software installed and
configured.

-  Python 2 (2.6+)
-  ``pip`` and optionally ``virtualenv``
-  Java 1.6+
-  SSH client with an SSH keypair
-  Web browser

All of the supported platforms have widely available versions of
Python and Java available. Linux and Mac machines already have an SSH
client installed; Windows users can download Putty. Windows users will
also need to ensure that PowerShell (or another shell) is installed.

For the Java dependency any certified version of Java 1.6 or later
will work. Notably the versions OpenJDK and Oracle are known to
work. The java compiler from GNU (``gjc``) does **not** work and
should never be used.
