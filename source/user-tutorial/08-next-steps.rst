Next Steps
==========

This tutorial has shown you the core functionality available on a
StratusLab cloud infrastructure.  With just this functionality a large
majority of use cases are covered.  Nonetheless you are invited to
look through the User Guide to acquaint yourself with advanced
StratusLab features. 

Concretely, some advanced use cases require you to create new
appliances or data sets and to register them in the Marketplace.
Information about performing those tasks (as well as other advanced
features) can be found in the more extensive User Guide.

If you don't find the information or features you need in the
documentation, contact StratusLab support for help!
