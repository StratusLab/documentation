# Introduction

StratusLab, an international collaboration, provides a complete, open
source cloud distribution, allowing the installation of public or
private "Infrastructure as a Service" cloud infrastructures.  It aims
to be both simple to use and simple to install.

Cloud infrastructures provide many benefits to developers and
end-users (scientists and engineers).  End-users appreciate the
cloud's ability:

  * To provide a customized execution environment, 
  * To make available pre-installed and pre-configured applications,
  * To provision new resources (CPU, storage, etc.) rapidly, and
  * To allow complete control of those resources. 

Application and service developers also appreciate:

  * Easy access to the services through simple APIs and 
  * The elasticity of the cloud to respond to peaks in demand.

StratusLab provides a couple mechanisms for accessing cloud resources:
a command line interface written in portable python and web interfaces
(for a subset of services).  Developers can also use the Libcloud API,
the StratusLab Python API, or the service REST APIs for programmatic
access.
