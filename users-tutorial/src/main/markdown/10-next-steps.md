# Next Steps

This tutorial has demonstrated the core features of the StratusLab
cloud distribution.  Already with the features presented here, you can
go a long way in using the cloud for running your applications and
analyses.

There are, however, a number of more advanced topics that will allow
you to more efficiently use the infrastructure.  Check out the
complete User's Guide to get an overview of all of the features and to
understand the core features in more detail.

If you don't find the information you need on the website or in the
documentation, don't hesitate to contact the developers via the
support@stratuslab.eu mailing list.
